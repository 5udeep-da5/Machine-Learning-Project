# Machine-Learning-Project
Use Machine Learning Models on the dataset to aquire the desired answers
Problem 1:
You work for an office transport company. You are in discussions with ABC Consulting company for providing transport for their employees. For this purpose, you are tasked with understanding how do the employees of ABC Consulting prefer to commute presently (between home and office). Based on the parameters like age, salary, work experience etc. given in the data set ‘Transport.csv’, you are required to predict the preferred mode of transport. The project requires you to build several Machine Learning models and compare them so that the model can be finalised.

Problem 2:
A dataset of Shark Tank episodes is made available. It contains 495 entrepreneurs making their pitch to the VC sharks.
